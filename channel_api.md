There are two parallel client APIs available. One uses promises, and
the other uses callbacks, *mutatis mutandis*. Since they present much
the same set of objects and methods, you are free to choose which you
prefer, without missing out on any features. However, they don't mix
-- a channel from the promises API has only the promise-based methods,
and likewise the callback API -- so it is best to pick one and stick
with it.

The promise-based API is the "main" module in the library:

```javascript
var amqp = require('amqplib');
```

You can access the callback-based API this way:

```javascript
var amqp = require('amqplib/callback_api');
```

In the following I use "resolve", "resolving" etc., to refer either to
resolving a returned promise (usually with a value); or in the
callback API, invoking a supplied callback with `null` as the first
argument (and usually some value as the second argument). Likewise,
"reject" etc., will mean rejecting a promise or calling the callback
with an `Error` as the first argument (and no value).

[^top](#top)

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

The client APIs are based closely on the protocol model. The general
idea is to connect, then create one or more channels on which to issue
commands, send messages, and so on. Most errors in AMQP invalidate
just the channel which had problems, so this ends up being a fairly
natural way to use AMQP. The downside is that it doesn't give any
guidance on *useful* ways to use AMQP; that is, it does little beyond
giving access to the various AMQP commands.

Most operations in AMQP are RPCs, synchronous at the channel layer of
the protocol but asynchronous from the library's point of
view. Accordingly, most methods either return promises, or accept
callbacks, yielding the server's reply (often containing useful
information such as generated identifiers). RPCs are queued by the
channel if it is already waiting for a reply -- synchronising on RPCs
in this way is implicitly required by the protocol specification.

Some methods are not RPCs -- they do not have responses from the
server. These return either nothing (`ack[All]`, `nack[All]`, `reject`) or a
boolean (`publish` and `sendToQueue`); see [flow
control](#flowcontrol).

[^top](#top)

## <a name="failure"></a>Dealing with failure

Most operations in AMQP act like assertions, failing if the desired
conditions cannot be met; for example, if a queue being declared
already exists but with different properties. A failed operation will

 * reject the current RPC, if there is one
 * invalidate the channel object, meaning further operations will
   throw an exception
 * reject any RPCs waiting to be sent
 * cause the channel object to emit `'error'`
 * cause the channel object to emit `'close'`

Since the RPCs are effectively synchronised, any such channel error is
very likely to have been caused by the outstanding RPC. However, it's
often sufficient to fire off a number of RPCs and check only the
result for the last, since it'll be rejected if it or any of its
predecessors fail.

The exception thrown on operations subsequent to a failure *or*
channel close also contains the stack at the point that the channel
was closed, in the field `stackAtStateChange`. This may be useful to
determine what has caused an unexpected closure.

```js
connection.createChannel().then(function(ch) {
  ch.close();
  try {
    ch.close();
  }
  catch (alreadyClosed) {
    console.log(alreadyClosed.stackAtStateChange);
  }
});
```

[^top](#top)

### <a name="failure_promises"></a>Exceptions and promises

Promises returned from methods are amenable to composition using, for
example, when.js's functions:

```javascript
amqp.connect().then(function(conn) {
  var ok = conn.createChannel();
  ok = ok.then(function(ch) {
    return when.all([
      ch.assertQueue('foo'),
      ch.assertExchange('bar'),
      ch.bindQueue('foo', 'bar', 'baz'),
      ch.consume('foo', handleMessage)
    ]);
  });
  return ok;
}).then(null, console.warn);
```

If an exception is thrown in a promise continuation, the promise
library will redirect control to a *following* error continuation:

```js
amqp.connect().then(function(conn) {
 // Everything ok, but ..
 throw new Error('SNAFU');
}, function(err) {
 console.error('Connect failed: %s', err);
}).then(null, function(err) {
  console.error('Connect succeeded, but error thrown: %s', err);
});
```

[^top](#top)

### <a name="failure_callbacks"></a>Exceptions and callbacks

The callback API expects callbacks that follow the convention
`function(err, value) {...}`. This library does not attempt to deal
with exceptions thrown in callbacks, so in general they will trigger
the last-resort `'uncaughtException'` event of the process.

However, since the connection and channels are `EventEmitter`s, they
can be bound to a domain:

```js
var dom = domain.create();
dom.on('error', gracefullyRestart);

amqp.connect(function(err, conn) {
 dom.add(conn);
 //...
});
```

Implicit binding works for connections or channels created within a
`Domain#run`.

```js
var dom = domain.create();
dom.on('error', gracefullyRestart);

dom.run(function() {
  amqp.connect(function(err, conn) {
      // ...
  });
});
```

[^top](#top)

## <a name="flowcontrol"></a>Flow control

Channels act like [`stream.Writable`][nodejs-writable] when you call
`publish` or `sendToQueue`: they return either `true`, meaning "keep
sending", or `false`, meaning "please wait for a 'drain' event".

Those methods, along with `ack`, `ackAll`, `nack`, `nackAll`, and
`reject`, do not have responses from the server. This means they *do
not return a promise* in the promises API. The `ConfirmChannel` _does_
accept a callback in _both_ APIs, called when the server confirms the
message; as well as returning a boolean.

## <a name="args"></a>Argument handling

Many operations have mandatory arguments as well as optional arguments
with defaults; in general, the former appear as parameters to the
method while latter are collected in a single `options` parameter, to
be supplied as an object with the fields mentioned. Extraneous fields
in `options` are ignored, so it is often possible to coalesce the
options for a number of operations into a single object, should that
be convenient. Likewise, fields from the prototype chain are accepted,
so a common `options` value can be specialised by e.g., using
`Object.create(common)` then setting some fields.

Often, AMQP commands have an `arguments` table that can contain
arbitrary values, usually used by implementation-specific extensions
like
[RabbitMQ's consumer priorities][rabbitmq-consumer-priority]. This is
accessible as the option `arguments`, also an object: if an API method
does not account for an extension in its stated `options`, you can
fall back to using the `options.arguments` object, though bear in mind
that the field name will usually be 'x-something', while the options
are just 'something'. Values passed in `options`, if understood by the
API, will override those given in `options.arguments`.

```js
var common_options = {durable: true, noAck: true};
ch.assertQueue('foo', common_options);
// Only 'durable' counts for queues

var bar_opts = Object.create(common_options);
bar_opts.autoDelete = true;
// "Subclass" our options
ch.assertQueue('bar', bar_opts);

var foo_consume_opts = Object.create(common_options);
foo_consume_opts.arguments = {'x-priority': 10};
ch.consume('foo', console.log, foo_consume_opts);
// Use the arguments table to give a priority, even though it's
// available as an option

var bar_consume_opts = Object.create(foo_consume_opts);
bar_consume_opts.priority = 5;
ch.consume('bar', console.log, bar_consume_opts);
// The 'priority' option will override that given in the arguments
// table
```

## <a name="api_reference"></a>API reference

### <a name="connect"></a>connect

##### Promises

`connect([url, [socketOptions]])`

##### Callbacks

`connect([url, [socketOptions]], function(err, conn) {...})`

Connect to an AMQP 0-9-1 server, optionally given an AMQP URL (see
[AMQP URI syntax][amqpurl]) and socket options. The protocol part
(`amqp:` or `amqps:`) is mandatory; defaults for elided parts are as
given in `'amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672'`. If the URI is omitted
entirely, it will default to `'amqp://localhost'`, which given the
defaults for missing parts, will connect to a RabbitMQ installation
with factory settings, on localhost.

###### auth

The auth section (`guest:guest` above) is treated as one section for
the purpose of default values; if anything appears there, it will
taken as giving both the username and password (and if either is
absent, it will be treated as empty i.e., `''`).

The username is everything up to the first colon `':'` _after_ URL
decoding; be careful using colons in usernames, even if encoded. If
there is no colon, the username is the whole auth section.

###### vhost

For convenience, an _absent_ path segment (e.g., as in the URLs just
given) is interpreted as the virtual host named `/`, which is present
in RabbitMQ out of the box. Per the URI specification, _just a
trailing slash_ as in `'amqp://localhost/'` would indicate the virtual
host with an empty name, which does not exist unless it's been
explicitly created. When specifying another virtual host, remember
that its name must be escaped; so e.g., the virtual host named `/foo`
is `'%2Ffoo'`; in a full URI, `'amqp://localhost/%2Ffoo'`.

###### tuning parameters

Further AMQP tuning parameters may be given in the query part of the
URI, e.g., as in `'amqp://localhost?frameMax=0x1000'`. These are:

 * `frameMax`, the size in bytes of the maximum frame allowed over the
   connection. `0` means no limit (but since frames have a size field
   which is an unsigned 32 bit integer, it's perforce `2^32 - 1`); I
   default it to 0x1000, i.e. 4kb, which is the allowed minimum, will
   fit many purposes, and not chug through Node.JS's buffer pooling.

 * `channelMax`, the maximum number of channels allowed. Default is
   `0`, meaning `2^16 - 1`.

 * `heartbeat`: the period of the connection heartbeat, in
   seconds. Defaults to `0`; see [heartbeating](#heartbeating)

 * `locale`: the desired locale for error messages, I
   suppose. RabbitMQ only ever uses `en_US`; which, happily, is the
   default.

###### Connecting with an object instead of a URL

The URL can also be supplied as an object of the form:

```
{
  protocol: 'amqp',
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: 5672,
  username: 'guest',
  password: 'guest',
  locale: 'en_US',
  frameMax: 0,
  heartbeat: 0,
  vhost: '/',
}
```

in which case the values discussed above will be taken directly from
the fields. Absent fields will be given defaults as for a URL supplied
as a string.

###### Socket options

The socket options will be passed to the socket library (`net` or
`tls`). In an exception to the general rule, *they must be fields set
on the object supplied*; that is, not in the prototype chain. The
socket options is useful for supplying certificates and so on for an
SSL connection; see the [SSL guide][ssl-doc].

The socket options may also include the key `noDelay`, with a boolean
value. If the value is `true`, this sets
[`TCP_NODELAY`][wikipedia-nagling] on the underlying socket.

###### Result

The returned promise, or supplied callback, will either be resolved
with an object representing an open connection, or rejected with a
sympathetically-worded error (in en_US).

Supplying a malformed URI will cause `connect()` to throw an
exception; other problems, including refused and dropped TCP
connections, will result in a rejection.

RabbitMQ since version 3.2.0 will send a frame to notify the client of
authentication failures, which results in a rejection. RabbitMQ before
version 3.2.0, per the AMQP specification, will close the socket in
the case of an authentication failure, making a dropped connection
ambiguous (it will also wait a few seconds before doing so).

##### Heartbeating

If you supply a non-zero period in seconds as the `heartbeat`
parameter, the connection will be monitored for liveness. If the
client fails to read data from the connection for two successive
intervals, the connection will emit an error and close. It will also
send heartbeats to the server (in the absence of other data).

If you supply `0` as the `heartbeat` parameter (or defaults to `0`), the
server value is used. This means that you can only disable heartbeat if
the server value is also `0`. See
[here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html) for more details.

NOTE: Please consider NOT disabling heartbeats because they exist for a
[reason](http://www.rabbitmq.com/heartbeats.html).

## <a name="models"></a>ChannelModel and CallbackModel

These constructors represent connections in the channel APIs. They
take as an argument a `connection.Connection`. It is better to use
`connect()`, which will open the connection for you. The constructors
are exported as potential extension points.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="model_close"></a>{Channel,Callback}Model#close

##### Promises

`connection.close()`

##### Callbacks

`connection.close([function(err) {...}])`

Close the connection cleanly. Will immediately invalidate any
unresolved operations, so it's best to make sure you've done
everything you need to before calling this. Will be resolved once the
connection, and underlying socket, are closed. The model will also
emit `'close'` at that point.

Although it's not strictly necessary, it will avoid some warnings in
the server log if you close the connection before exiting:

```javascript
var open = amqp.connect();
open.then(function(conn) {
  var ok = doStuffWithConnection(conn);
  return ok.then(conn.close.bind(conn));
}).then(null, console.warn);
```

Note that I'm synchronising on the return value of
`doStuffWithConnection()`, assumed here to be a promise, so that I can
be sure I'm all done. The callback version looks like this:

```javascript
amqp.connect(function(err, conn) {
  if (err !== null) return console.warn(err);
  doStuffWithConnection(conn, function() {
    conn.close();
  });
});
```

There it's assumed that doStuffWithConnection invokes its second
argument once it's all finished.

If your program runs until interrupted, you can hook into the process
signal handling to close the connection:

```javascript
var open = amqp.connect();
open.then(function(conn) {
  process.once('SIGINT', conn.close.bind(conn));
  return doStuffWithConnection(conn);
}).then(null, console.warn);
```

**NB** it's no good using `process.on('exit', ...)`, since `close()` needs
to do I/O.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="model_events"></a>{Channel,Callback}Model events

`#on('close', function() {...})`

Emitted once the closing handshake initiated by `#close()` has
completed; or, if server closed the connection, once the client has
sent the closing handshake; or, if the underlying stream (e.g.,
socket) has closed.

In the case of a server-initiated shutdown _or_ an error, the
`'close'` handler will be supplied with an error indicating the
cause. You can ignore this if you don't care why the connection
closed; or, you can test it with
`require('amqplib/lib/connection').isFatalError(err)` to see if it was
a crash-worthy error.

`#on('error', function (err) {...})`

Emitted if the connection closes for a reason other than `#close`
being called or a graceful server-initiated close; such reasons
include:

 * a protocol transgression the server detected (likely a bug in this
   library)
 * a server error
 * a network error
 * the server thinks the client is dead due to a missed heartbeat

A graceful close may be initiated by an operator (e.g., with an admin
tool), or if the server is shutting down; in this case, no `'error'`
event will be emitted.

`'close'` will also be emitted, after `'error'`.

`#on('blocked', function(reason) {...})`

Emitted when a RabbitMQ server (after version 3.2.0) decides to block
the connection. Typically it will do this if there is some resource
shortage, e.g., memory, and messages are published on the
connection. See the RabbitMQ [documentation for this
extension][rabbitmq-connection-blocked] for details.

`#on('unblocked', function() {...})`

Emitted at some time after `'blocked'`, once the resource shortage has
alleviated.

### <a name="model_createChannel"></a>{Channel,Callback}Model#createChannel

##### Promises

`#createChannel()`

##### Callbacks

`#createChannel(function(err, channel) {...})`

Resolves to an open `Channel` (The callback version returns the
channel; but it is not usable before the callback has been
invoked). May fail if there are no more channels available (i.e., if
there are already `channelMax` channels open).

[^top](#top)

### <a name="model_createConfirmChannel"></a>{Channel,Callback}Model#createConfirmChannel

##### Promises

`#createConfirmChannel()`

##### Callbacks

`#createConfirmChannel(function(err, channel) {...})`

Open a fresh channel, switched to "confirmation mode". See
`ConfirmChannel` below.

[^top](#top)

## <a name="channel"></a>Channels

There are channel objects in each of the APIs, and these contain most
of the methods for getting things done.

`new Channel(connection)`

This constructor represents a protocol channel. Channels are
multiplexed over connections, and represent something like a session,
in that most operations (and thereby most errors) are scoped to
channels.

The constructor is exported from the API modules as an extension
point. When using a client API, obtain an open `Channel` by opening a
connection (`connect()` above) and calling `#createChannel` or
`#createConfirmChannel`.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_close"></a>Channel#close

##### Promises

`Channel#close()`

##### Callbacks

`Channel#close([function(err) {...}])`

Close a channel. Will be resolved with no value once the closing
handshake is complete.

There's not usually any reason to close a channel rather than
continuing to use it until you're ready to close the connection
altogether. However, the lifetimes of consumers are scoped to
channels, and thereby other things such as exclusive locks on queues,
so it is occasionally worth being deliberate about opening and closing
channels.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_events"></a>Channel events

`#on('close', function() {...})`

A channel will emit `'close'` once the closing handshake (possibly
initiated by `#close()`) has completed; or, if its connection closes.

When a channel closes, any unresolved operations on the channel will
be abandoned (and the returned promises rejected).

`#on('error', function(err) {...})`

A channel will emit `'error'` if the server closes the channel for any
reason. Such reasons include

 * an operation failed due to a failed precondition (usually
  something named in an argument not existing)
 * an human closed the channel with an admin tool

A channel will not emit `'error'` if its connection closes with an
error.

`#on('return', function(msg) {...})`

If a message is published with the `mandatory` flag (it's an option to
`Channel#publish` in this API), it may be returned to the sending
channel if it cannot be routed. Whenever this happens, the channel
will emit `return` with a message object (as described in `#consume`)
as an argument.

`#on('drain', function() {...})`

Like a [stream.Writable][nodejs-drain], a channel will emit `'drain'`,
if it has previously returned `false` from `#publish` or
`#sendToQueue`, once its write buffer has been emptied (i.e., once it
is ready for writes again).

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_assertQueue"></a>Channel#assertQueue

##### Promises

`#assertQueue([queue, [options]])`

##### Callbacks

`#assertQueue([queue, [options, [function(err, ok) {...}]]])`

Assert a queue into existence. This operation is idempotent given
identical arguments; however, it will bork the channel if the queue
already exists but has different properties (values supplied in the
`arguments` field may or may not count for borking purposes; check the
borker's, I mean broker's, documentation).

`queue` is a string; if you supply an empty string or other falsey
value (including `null` and `undefined`), the server will create a
random name for you.

`options` is an object and may be empty or null, or outright omitted
if it's the last argument. The relevant fields in options are:

 * `exclusive`: if true, scopes the queue to the connection (defaults
  to false)

 * `durable`: if true, the queue will survive broker restarts, modulo
  the effects of `exclusive` and `autoDelete`; this defaults to true
  if not supplied, unlike the others

 * `autoDelete`: if true, the queue will be deleted when the number of
  consumers drops to zero (defaults to false)

 * `arguments`: additional arguments, usually parameters for some kind
  of broker-specific extension e.g., high availability, TTL.

RabbitMQ extensions can also be supplied as options. These typically
require non-standard `x-*` keys and values, sent in the `arguments`
table; e.g., `'x-expires'`. When supplied in `options`, the `x-`
prefix for the key is removed; e.g., `'expires'`. Values supplied in
`options` will overwrite any analogous field you put in
`options.arguments`.

 * `messageTtl` (0 <= n < 2^32): expires messages arriving in the
  queue after n milliseconds

 * `expires` (0 < n < 2^32): the queue will be destroyed after n
  milliseconds of disuse, where use means having consumers, being
  declared (asserted or checked, in this API), or being polled with a
  `#get`.

 * `deadLetterExchange` (string): an exchange to which messages
  discarded from the queue will be resent. Use `deadLetterRoutingKey`
  to set a routing key for discarded messages; otherwise, the
  message's routing key (and CC and BCC, if present) will be
  preserved. A message is discarded when it expires or is rejected or
  nacked, or the queue limit is reached.

 * `maxLength` (positive integer): sets a maximum number of messages
  the queue will hold. Old messages will be discarded (dead-lettered
  if that's set) to make way for new messages.

 * `maxPriority` (positive integer): makes the queue a [priority
   queue][rabbitmq-priority-queue].

Resolves to the "ok" reply from the server, which includes fields for
the queue name (important if you let the server name it), a recent
consumer count, and a recent message count; e.g.,

```javascript
{
  queue: 'foobar',
  messageCount: 0,
  consumerCount: 0
}
```

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_checkQueue"></a>Channel#checkQueue

##### Promises

`#checkQueue(queue)`

##### Callbacks

`#checkQueue(queue, [function(err, ok) {...}])`

Check whether a queue exists. This will bork the channel if the named
queue *doesn't* exist; if it does exist, you go through to the next
round!  There's no options, unlike `#assertQueue()`, just the queue
name. The reply from the server is the same as for `#assertQueue()`.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_deleteQueue"></a>Channel#deleteQueue

##### Promises

`#deleteQueue(queue, [options])`

##### Callbacks

`#deleteQueue(queue, [options, [function(err, ok) {...}]])`

Delete the queue named. Naming a queue that doesn't exist will result
in the server closing the channel, to teach you a lesson (except in
RabbitMQ version 3.2.0 and after[1][rabbitmq-idempotent-delete]). The
options here are:

 * `ifUnused` (boolean): if true and the queue has consumers, it will
   not be deleted and the channel will be closed. Defaults to false.

 * `ifEmpty` (boolean): if true and the queue contains messages, the
   queue will not be deleted and the channel will be closed. Defaults
   to false.

Note the obverse semantics of the options: if both are true, the queue
will be deleted only if it has no consumers *and* no messages.

You should leave out the options altogether if you want to delete the
queue unconditionally.

The server reply contains a single field, `messageCount`, with the
number of messages deleted or dead-lettered along with the queue.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_purgeQueue"></a>Channel#purgeQueue

##### Promises

`#purgeQueue(queue)`

##### Callbacks

`#purgeQueue(queue, [function(err, ok) {...}])`

Remove all undelivered messages from the `queue` named. Note that this
won't remove messages that have been delivered but not yet
acknowledged; they will remain, and may be requeued under some
circumstances (e.g., if the channel to which they were delivered
closes without acknowledging them).

The server reply contains a single field, `messageCount`, containing
the number of messages purged from the queue.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_bindQueue"></a>Channel#bindQueue

##### Promises

`#bindQueue(queue, source, pattern, [args])`

##### Callbacks

`#bindQueue(queue, source, pattern, [args, [function(err, ok) {...}]])`

Assert a routing path from an exchange to a queue: the exchange named
by `source` will relay messages to the `queue` named, according to the
type of the exchange and the `pattern` given. The [RabbitMQ
tutorials][rabbitmq-tutes] give a good account of how routing works in
AMQP.

`args` is an object containing extra arguments that may be required
for the particular exchange type (for which, see
[your server's documentation][rabbitmq-docs]). It may be omitted if
it's the last argument, which is equivalent to an empty object.

The server reply has no fields.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_unbindQueue"></a>Channel#unbindQueue

##### Promises

`#unbindQueue(queue, source, pattern, [args])`

##### Callbacks

`#unbindQueue(queue, source, pattern, [args, [function(err, ok) {...}]])`

Remove a routing path between the `queue` named and the exchange named
as `source` with the `pattern` and arguments given. Omitting `args` is
equivalent to supplying an empty object (no arguments). Beware:
attempting to unbind when there is no such binding may result in a
punitive error (the AMQP specification says it's a connection-killing
mistake; RabbitMQ before version 3.2.0 softens this to a channel
error, and from version 3.2.0, doesn't treat it as an error at
all[1][rabbitmq-idempotent-delete]. Good ol' RabbitMQ).

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_assertExchange"></a>Channel#assertExchange

##### Promises

`#assertExchange(exchange, type, [options])`

##### Callbacks

`#assertExchange(exchange, type, [options, [function(err, ok) {...}]])`

Assert an exchange into existence. As with queues, if the exchange
exists already and has properties different to those supplied, the
channel will 'splode; fields in the arguments object may or may not be
'splodey, depending on the type of exchange. Unlike queues, you must
supply a name, and it can't be the empty string. You must also supply
an exchange type, which determines how messages will be routed through
the exchange.

**NB** There is just one RabbitMQ extension pertaining to exchanges in
general (`alternateExchange`); however, specific exchange types may
use the `arguments` table to supply parameters.

The options:

 * `durable` (boolean): if true, the exchange will survive broker
  restarts. Defaults to true.

 * `internal` (boolean): if true, messages cannot be published
  directly to the exchange (i.e., it can only be the target of
  bindings, or possibly create messages ex-nihilo). Defaults to false.

 * `autoDelete` (boolean): if true, the exchange will be destroyed
  once the number of bindings for which it is the source drop to
  zero. Defaults to false.

 * `alternateExchange` (string): an exchange to send messages to if
  this exchange can't route them to any queues.

 * `arguments` (object): any additional arguments that may be needed
   by an exchange type.

The server reply echoes the exchange name, in the field `exchange`.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_checkExchange"></a>Channel#checkExchange

##### Promises

`#checkExchange(exchange)`

##### Callbacks

`#checkExchange(exchange, [function(err, ok) {...}])`

Check that an exchange exists. If it doesn't exist, the channel will
be closed with an error. If it does exist, happy days.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_deleteExchange"></a>Channel#deleteExchange

##### Promises

`#deleteExchange(name, [options])`

##### Callbacks

`#deleteExchange(name, [options, [function(err, ok) {...}]])`

Delete an exchange. The only meaningful field in `options` is:

 * `ifUnused` (boolean): if true and the exchange has bindings, it
  will not be deleted and the channel will be closed.

If the exchange does not exist, a channel error is raised (RabbitMQ
version 3.2.0 and after will not raise an
error[1][rabbitmq-idempotent-delete]).

The server reply has no fields.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_bindExchange"></a>Channel#bindExchange

##### Promises

`#bindExchange(destination, source, pattern, [args])`

##### Callbacks

`#bindExchange(destination, source, pattern, [args, [function(err, ok) {...}]])`

Bind an exchange to another exchange. The exchange named by
`destination` will receive messages from the exchange named by
`source`, according to the type of the source and the `pattern`
given. For example, a `direct` exchange will relay messages that have
a routing key equal to the pattern.

**NB** Exchange to exchange binding is a RabbitMQ extension.

The server reply has no fields.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_unbindExchange"></a>Channel#unbindExchange

##### Promises

`#unbindExchange(destination, source, pattern, [args])`

##### Callbacks

`#unbindExchange(destination, source, pattern, [args, [function(err, ok) {...}]])`

Remove a binding from an exchange to another exchange. A binding with
the exact `source` exchange, `destination` exchange, routing key
`pattern`, and extension `args` will be removed. If no such binding
exists, it's &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; a channel error, except in
RabbitMQ >= version 3.2.0, for which it succeeds
trivially[1][rabbitmq-idempotent-delete].

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_publish"></a>Channel#publish

##### Promises or callbacks

`#publish(exchange, routingKey, content, [options])`

Publish a single message to an exchange. The mandatory parameters are:

 * `exchange` and `routingKey`: the exchange and routing key, which
 determine where the message goes. A special case is sending `''` as
 the exchange, which will send directly to the queue named by the
 routing key; `#sendToQueue` below is equivalent to this special
 case. If the named exchange does not exist, the channel will be
 closed.

 * `content`: a buffer containing the message content. This will be
 copied during encoding, so it is safe to mutate it once this method
 has returned.

The remaining parameters are provided as fields in `options`, and are
divided into those that have some meaning to RabbitMQ and those that
will be ignored by RabbitMQ but passed on to consumers. `options` may
be omitted altogether, in which case defaults as noted will apply.

The "meaningful" options are a mix of fields in BasicDeliver (the
method used to publish a message), BasicProperties (in the message
header frame) and RabbitMQ extensions which are given in the `headers`
table in BasicProperties.

Used by RabbitMQ and sent on to consumers:

 * `expiration` (string): if supplied, the message will be discarded
   from a queue once it's been there longer than the given number of
   milliseconds. In the specification this is a string; numbers
   supplied here will be coerced to strings for transit.

 * `userId` (string): If supplied, RabbitMQ will compare it to the
   username supplied when opening the connection, and reject messages
   for which it does not match.

 * `CC` (string or array of string): an array of routing keys as
   strings; messages will be routed to these routing keys in addition
   to that given as the `routingKey` parameter. A string will be
   implicitly treated as an array containing just that string. This
   will override any value given for `CC` in the `headers`
   parameter. **NB** The property names `CC` and `BCC` are
   case-sensitive.

 * `priority` (positive integer): a priority for the message; ignored
    by versions of RabbitMQ older than 3.5.0, or if the queue is not a
    [priority queue][rabbitmq-priority-queue] (see `maxPriority`
    above).

 * `persistent` (boolean): If truthy, the message will survive broker
   restarts provided it's in a queue that also survives
   restarts. Corresponds to, and overrides, the property
   `deliveryMode`.

 * `deliveryMode` (boolean or numeric): Either `1` or falsey, meaning
   non-persistent; or, `2` or truthy, meaning persistent. That's just
   obscure though. Use the option `persistent` instead.

Used by RabbitMQ but not sent on to consumers:

 * `mandatory` (boolean): if true, the message will be returned if it
   is not routed to a queue (i.e., if there are no bindings that match
   its routing key).

 * `BCC` (string or array of string): like `CC`, except that the value
   will not be sent in the message headers to consumers.

Not used by RabbitMQ and not sent to consumers:

 * `immediate` (boolean): in the specification, this instructs the
   server to return the message if it is not able to be sent
   immediately to a consumer. No longer implemented in RabbitMQ, and
   if true, will provoke a channel error, so it's best to leave it
   out.

Ignored by RabbitMQ (but may be useful for applications):

 * `contentType` (string): a MIME type for the message content

 * `contentEncoding` (string): a MIME encoding for the message content

 * `headers` (object): application specific headers to be carried
   along with the message content. The value as sent may be augmented
   by extension-specific fields if they are given in the parameters,
   for example, 'CC', since these are encoded as message headers; the
   supplied value won't be mutated

 * `correlationId` (string): usually used to match replies to
   requests, or similar

 * `replyTo` (string): often used to name a queue to which the
   receiving application must send replies, in an RPC scenario (many
   libraries assume this pattern)

 * `messageId` (string): arbitrary application-specific identifier for
   the message

 * `timestamp` (positive number): a timestamp for the message

 * `type` (string): an arbitrary application-specific type for the
   message

 * `appId` (string): an arbitrary identifier for the originating
   application

`#publish` mimics the [`stream.Writable`][nodejs-write] interface in
its return value; it will return `false` if the channel's write buffer
is 'full', and `true` otherwise. If it returns `false`, it will emit a
`'drain'` event at some later time.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_sendToQueue"></a>Channel#sendToQueue

##### Promises and callbacks

`#sendToQueue(queue, content, [options])`

Send a single message with the `content` given as a buffer to the
specific `queue` named, bypassing routing. The options and return
value are exactly the same as for `#publish`.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_consume"></a>Channel#consume

##### Promises

`#consume(queue, function(msg) {...}, [options])`

##### Callbacks

`#consume(queue, function(msg) {...}, [options, [function(err, ok) {...}]])`

Set up a consumer with a callback to be invoked with each message.

Options (which may be omitted if the last argument):

 * `consumerTag` (string): a name which the server will use to
  distinguish message deliveries for the consumer; mustn't be already
  in use on the channel. It's usually easier to omit this, in which
  case the server will create a random name and supply it in the
  reply.

 * `noLocal` (boolean): in theory, if true then the broker won't
  deliver messages to the consumer if they were also published on this
  connection; RabbitMQ doesn't implement it though, and will ignore
  it. Defaults to false.

 * `noAck` (boolean): if true, the broker won't expect an
  acknowledgement of messages delivered to this consumer; i.e., it
  will dequeue messages as soon as they've been sent down the
  wire. Defaults to false (i.e., you will be expected to acknowledge
  messages).

 * `exclusive` (boolean): if true, the broker won't let anyone else
  consume from this queue; if there already is a consumer, there goes
  your channel (so usually only useful if you've made a 'private'
  queue by letting the server choose its name).

 * `priority` (integer): gives a priority to the consumer; higher
   priority consumers get messages in preference to lower priority
   consumers. See [this RabbitMQ extension's
   documentation][rabbitmq-consumer-priority]

 * `arguments` (object): arbitrary arguments. Go to town.

The server reply contains one field, `consumerTag`. It is necessary to
remember this somewhere if you will later want to cancel this consume
operation (i.e., to stop getting messages).

The message callback supplied in the second argument will be invoked
with message objects of this shape:

```javascript
{
  content: Buffer,
  fields: Object,
  properties: Object
}
```

The message `content` is a buffer containing the bytes published.

The fields object has a handful of bookkeeping values largely of
interest only to the library code: `deliveryTag`, a serial number for
the message; `consumerTag`, identifying the consumer for which the
message is destined; `exchange` and `routingKey` giving the routing
information with which the message was published; and, `redelivered`,
which if true indicates that this message has been delivered before
and been handed back to the server (e.g., by a nack or recover
operation).

The `properties` object contains message properties, which are all the
things mentioned under `#publish` as options that are
transmitted. Note that RabbitMQ extensions (just `CC`, presently) are
sent in the `headers` table so will appear there in deliveries.

If the [consumer is cancelled][rabbitmq-consumer-cancel] by RabbitMQ,
the message callback will be invoked with `null`.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_cancel"></a>Channel#cancel

##### Promises

`#cancel(consumerTag)`

##### Callbacks

`#cancel(consumerTag, [function(err, ok) {...}])`

This instructs the server to stop sending messages to the consumer
identified by `consumerTag`. Messages may arrive between sending this
and getting its reply; once the reply has resolved, however, there
will be no more messages for the consumer, i.e., the message callback
will no longer be invoked.

The `consumerTag` is the string given in the reply to `#consume`,
which may have been generated by the server.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_get"></a>Channel#get

##### Promises

`#get(queue, [options])`

##### Callbacks

`#get(queue, [options, [function(err, msgOrFalse) {...}]])`

Ask a queue for a message, as an RPC. This will be resolved with
either `false`, if there is no message to be had (the queue has no
messages ready), or a message in the same shape as detailed in
`#consume`.

Options:

 * `noAck` (boolean): if true, the message will be assumed by the server
   to be acknowledged (i.e., dequeued) as soon as it's been sent over
   the wire. Default is false, that is, you will be expected to
   acknowledge the message.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_ack"></a>Channel#ack

##### Promises and callbacks

`#ack(message, [allUpTo])`

Acknowledge the given message, or all messages up to and including the
given message.

If a `#consume` or `#get` is issued with noAck: false (the default),
the server will expect acknowledgements for messages before forgetting
about them. If no such acknowledgement is given, those messages may be
requeued once the channel is closed.

If `allUpTo` is true, all outstanding messages prior to and including
the given message shall be considered acknowledged. If false, or
omitted, only the message supplied is acknowledged.

It's an error to supply a message that either doesn't require
acknowledgement, or has already been acknowledged. Doing so will
errorise the channel. If you want to acknowledge all the messages and
you don't have a specific message around, use `#ackAll`.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_ackAll"></a>Channel#ackAll

##### Promises and callbacks

`#ackAll()`

Acknowledge all outstanding messages on the channel. This is a "safe"
operation, in that it won't result in an error even if there are no
such messages.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_nack"></a>Channel#nack

#### Promises and callbacks

`#nack(message, [allUpTo, [requeue]])`

Reject a message. This instructs the server to either requeue the
message or throw it away (which may result in it being dead-lettered).

If `allUpTo` is truthy, all outstanding messages prior to and including
the given message are rejected. As with `#ack`, it's a channel-ganking
error to use a message that is not outstanding. Defaults to `false`.

If `requeue` is truthy, the server will try to put the message or
messages back on the queue or queues from which they came. Defaults to
`true` if not given, so if you want to make sure messages are
dead-lettered or discarded, supply `false` here.

This and `#nackAll` use a [RabbitMQ-specific
extension][rabbitmq-nack].

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_nackAll"></a>Channel#nackAll

##### Promises and callbacks

`#nackAll([requeue])`

Reject all messages outstanding on this channel. If `requeue` is
truthy, or omitted, the server will try to re-enqueue the messages.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_reject"></a>Channel#reject

##### Promises and callbacks

`#reject(message, [requeue])`

Reject a message. Equivalent to `#nack(message, false, requeue)`, but
works in older versions of RabbitMQ (< v2.3.0) where `#nack` does not.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_prefetch"></a>Channel#prefetch

##### Promises and callbacks

`#prefetch(count, [global])`

Set the prefetch count for this channel. The `count` given is the
maximum number of messages sent over the channel that can be awaiting
acknowledgement; once there are `count` messages outstanding, the
server will not send more messages on this channel until one or more
have been acknowledged. A falsey value for `count` indicates no such
limit.

**NB** RabbitMQ v3.3.0 changes the meaning of prefetch (basic.qos) to
apply per-*consumer*, rather than per-channel. It will apply to
consumers started after the method is called. See
[rabbitmq-prefetch][].

Use the `global` flag to get the per-channel behaviour. To keep life
interesting, using the `global` flag with an RabbitMQ older than
v3.3.0 will bring down the whole connection.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="channel_recover"></a>Channel#recover

##### Promises

`#recover()`

##### Callbacks

`#recover([function(err, ok) {...}])`

Requeue unacknowledged messages on this channel. The server will reply
(with an empty object) once all messages are requeued.

[^top](#top)

## <a name="confirmchannel"></a>ConfirmChannel

A channel which uses "confirmation mode" (a
[RabbitMQ extension][rabbitmq-confirms]).

On a channel in confirmation mode, each published message is 'acked'
or (in exceptional circumstances) 'nacked' by the server, thereby
indicating that it's been dealt with.

A confirm channel has the same methods as a regular channel, except
that `#publish` and `#sendToQueue` accept a callback as an additional
argument:

```javascript
var open = require('amqplib').connect();
open.then(function(c) {
  c.createConfirmChannel().then(function(ch) {
    ch.sendToQueue('foo', new Buffer('foobar'), {},
                   function(err, ok) {
                     if (err !== null)
                       console.warn('Message nacked!');
                     else
                       console.log('Message acked');
    });
  });
});
```

Or, with the callback API:

```javascript
require('amqplib/callback_api').connect(function(err, c) {
  c.createConfirmChannel(function(err, ch) {
    ch.sendToQueue('foo', new Buffer('foobar'), {}, function(err, ok) {
      if (err !== null) console.warn('Message nacked!');
      else console.log('Message acked');
    });
  });
});
```

In practice this means the `options` argument must be supplied, at
least as an empty object.

There are, broadly speaking, two uses for confirms. The first is to be
able to act on the information that a message has been accepted, for
example by responding to an upstream request. The second is to rate
limit a publisher by limiting the number of unconfirmed messages it's
allowed.

`new ConfirmChannel(connection)`

This constructor is a channel that uses confirms. It is exported as an
extension point. To obtain such a channel, use `connect` to get a
connection, then call `#createConfirmChannel`.

[^top](#top)

### <a name="confirmchannel_waitForConfirms"></a>ConfirmChannel#waitForConfirms

##### Promises

`#waitForConfirms()`

##### Callbacks

`#waitForConfirms(function(err) {...})`

Resolves the promise, or invokes the callback, when all published
messages have been confirmed. If any of the messages has been nacked,
this will result in an error; otherwise the result is no value. Either
way, the channel is still usable afterwards. It is also possible to
call waitForConfirms multiple times without waiting for previous
invocations to complete.

#### <a name="idempotent-deletes">RabbitMQ and deletion</a>

RabbitMQ version 3.2.0 makes queue and exchange deletions (and unbind)
effectively idempotent, by not raising an error if the exchange,
queue, or binding does not exist.

This does not apply to preconditions given to the operations. For
example deleting a queue with `{ifEmpty: true}` will still fail if
there are messages in the queue.
