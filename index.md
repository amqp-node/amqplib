# AMQP 0-9-1 library and client for Node.JS

`amqplib` implements the machinery needed to make clients for AMQP
0-9-1, and includes such a client. Why phrase it that way around?
Because AMQP is complicated enough that there are a few different ways
of presenting it in API form (e.g., [node-amqp][] deals with
exchanges and queues as first-class objects, while hiding channels;
[rabbit.js][] deprecates exchanges and queues in favour of
routing patterns).

AMQP often seems to be designed to confound client developers; it is
not very cleanly layered and there are consequences to molding it this
way or that in search of a usable API. In `amqplib` I have tried to
implement only the necessary machinery of AMQP, in layers as best I
can, without prejudice to any particular client API.

## Channel API overview

The client API included is channel-oriented. This represents the
protocol fairly directly, as connections and channels (something like
'sessions'). Most of the operations in the API are accessed by
creating a channel and calling methods; exchanges and queues are only
represented insofar as they are named (with strings) in these
operations.

Almost all operations are asynchronous RPCs; these methods on
`Channel` return promises which can be composed in all the usual
ways. Some operations (e.g., `#ack`) elicit no response from the
server, and don't return a promise.

In general I have made arguments that are mandatory in the protocol
into method arguments in the API, and coalesced optional arguments,
properties, and RabbitMQ extensions into a single `options` argument
which can be omitted altogether.

The [reference](doc/channel_api.html) has full details.

## Library overview

To be able to get anywhere at all, an AMQP library needs to be able to

 * parse and serialise frames
 * maintain connection and channel state
 * implement the opening and closing handshakes

In `amqplib`, parsing and serialising are dealt with in the modules

 * `codec` procedures for parsing and serialising values;
 *  `defs` generated code for encoding and decoding protocol methods;
    and,
 * `frames` for turning a byte streams into decoded frames and
   vice-versa.

Connection state is maintained in a `Connection` object (module
`connection`) and channel state in a `Channel` (module `channel`);
these two modules also implement the opening and closing handshakes.

The interfaces among these modules is small and mostly mediated with
primitive values; e.g., strings and numbers. A few points of interface
require callbacks in the form of duck-typed objects (e.g., an object
with an `#accept` method).
