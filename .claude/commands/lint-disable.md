Please follow the following process when I ask you to disable a lint rule using /lint-disable $rule

1. Create and change to a new branch. Ask for the branch name.
2. If the rule is off by default, delete it (See https://biomejs.dev/linter/javascript/rules/ for rule details)
3. If the rule is on by default, configure it to off in biome.json
4. Update the project changelog
5. Add the changes
6. Commit the changes
7. Push the changes
